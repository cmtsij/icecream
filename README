Hi!

This subdir isn't compiled because it installs a g++ replacement
and I don't want people to do that without explicit intend.

Thanks, Stephan

NOTE: Although icecream will compile on some non-Linux systems,
it depends critically on Linux' /proc/ structures and will fail
at runtime until somebody figures out how to emulate the "ticks"
form of process accounting in there.

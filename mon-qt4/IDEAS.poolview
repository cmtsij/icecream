- Basically like the star view; scheduler appears as an isle in the middle,
  nodes appear as differently colored luftmatrazen around the scheduler.
- Nodes slowly drift around the scheduler, in a circle
- When a node gets a call from the scheduler, that increases it's attraction
  to the scheduler for a time, away from the scheduler.

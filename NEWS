0.7.2 (r549439): 
	- split out libicecream-devel for the monitor
	- introducing ICECC_PREFERRED_HOST (=mybigfathost) to let the scheduler
          ignore all rules - this is meant to be a debugging aid
	- fix network performance between client and local daemon
	- replaced create-env with icecc --build-native (respecting the user's 
          $PATH by default)

0.7.1 (r548846):	
	- Monitor is an extra package now
	- don't make non-existant cross compilers fatal, but just use
          the other environments in ICECC_VERSION
	- always handle aborted syscalls
	- update minilzo
	- never exit() or return from fork()'ed code paths,
	 
0.7.0 (r547196):
        - WARNING: the protocol is not compatible with earlier versions, old clients
          will refuse to connect, so update the full farm

	- protocol reworked to no longer require a client->scheduler connection
           (the daemon will proxy it all)
        - all local jobs are now scheduled by the local daemon to make sure 
          multiprocessor machines are handling as many jobs as they have jobs
          configured (# processors). They used to be "scheduled" by lock file
	- fixed grave bug that removed all daemon environments when the cache
	  grew over limit
	- new telnet interface command: internals to output daemon states
	- stricter error handling to avoid suprises
	- SIGHUP to daemon and scheduler will reopen the log file to allow logrotate
	- a restart of the daemon and scheduler won't flush the log file, but append
	  to it
	- create-env will create .tar.gz now - the client allows environments to be
	  .tar, .tar.bz2 and .tar.gz

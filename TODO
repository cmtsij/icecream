Release Critical:
* bind the broadcast listener to fixed local port (8765) (otherwise not firewallable) (matz)
* chmod TMPDIR/native, as otherwise set umask prevent it from being readable by the client
   I'm wondering if it doesn't make sense to leave the daemon out of the game and let the
   client package the environment - it could either cache it in /tmp and leave a note in
   ~/.icecream or it packages it right into ~/.icecream and use e.g. the inode numbers of
   the compilers to verify it's the right environment - think NFS users changing machines.
   This would simplify some things and avoid the above bugs (and it would make it more
   convenient for users of /opt/gcc-cvs/bin too)
* Improve Documentation (cschum)
* make the protocol version an uint32, not a hand-build array.
* let the client specify it was compiled with recent compiler (supporting -param). If so,
  let the daemon compile with the options, otherwise leave them out. 
* The daemon always tries to find the scheduler and blocks for 2s each time while clients
  try to reach it to get local load balancing. 

Random:
* Option -iiface to specify the interface[s] to listen on for the scheduler, or
  to use for the daemon.
* Don't explicitly forbid tunnels because it could be useful for things like
  vmware
* If someone calls a amd64 client on a host that runs a ia32 daemon and there are
  no other amd64 daemons in the farm, he will get no answer, but a timeout from
  scheduler (quite a corner case, but neat)
* use syslog
* Log problems found at some scheduler log - or even in the monitor. E.g. if a client
  can't reach a given daemon, it should be able to tell. Perhaps the scheduler can even
  disable that very host for some penalty time
* Reduce amount of force-waits, especially if they involve network latency (scheduler queries)
  and daemon context switches:
    - remove the need for EndMsg
    - do not ask the daemon about the first job (WIP dirk)
* if a compile job SIGSEGV's or SIGABORTs, make sure to recompile locally because it could
  be just a glibc/kernel incompatibility on the remote site

Suggestions from "Wilson Snyder" sicortex.com:
- Add ICECREAM_RUN_ICECCD to make the scheduler machine not run iceccd
- Have schedulers redudant - e.g. as in nmbd
